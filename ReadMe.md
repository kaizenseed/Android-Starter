Android Starter Project

MVP + Android Architecture Components

This is a simple project that serves two purposes for me :
    - Starter project to serve as a beginning for larger projects.
    - Project with small scope that can be used while trying out new libraries, architecture patterns etc.

The project
- follows the MVP pattern.
- utilises some android architecture components, namely, Room, LiveData, Lifecysle aware owners and observers


Common Libraries used (apart from android support and design libraries etc)
- Android Lifecycle components
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html)
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) : for logging
- [Butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) : for view injections
- [ThreeTenABP](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP) for backported compatibility with Java8 Date & Time
- [Material Drawer](https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer) as replacement for std NavigationView
- From [Android Iconics](https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics?utm_source=android-arsenal.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1164), excluding core, add the typefaces as applicable to make it easier to have icons
