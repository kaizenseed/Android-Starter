Android Starter Project

MVP + Android Architecture Components

This is a simple project that serves two purposes for me :
    - Starter project to serve as a beginning for larger projects.
    - Project with small scope that can be used while trying out new libraries, architecture patterns etc.

The project
- follows the MVP pattern.
- utilises some android architecture components, namely, Room, LiveData


Common Libraries used (apart from android support and design libraries etc)
- Android Lifecycle components
- Room
- Timber : for logging
- Butterknife : for view injections
- ThreeTenABP for backported compatibility with Java8 Date & Time
